DAILY NUTRITIONAL TARGETS:
- Base Calories: ${baseRequirements.calories}
- Protein: ${baseRequirements.protein}g
- Carbohydrates: ${baseRequirements.carbs}g
- Fat: ${baseRequirements.fat}g

MEAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
You need to create a ${dayCount}-day meal plan. Here's the daily breakdown with run-specific adjustments:

${dailyBreakdown.map(day => `
DATE: ${day.date}
- Target Calories: ${day.targetCalories}
- ${day.hasRuns ? `RUN DAY: Additional ${day.runCalories} calories needed` : 'REST DAY'}
${day.runs.length > 0 ? `- Planned Runs: ${day.runs.map(r => `${r.title} (${r.distance}km, ${r.duration}min)`).join(', ')}` : ''}
- Meal Distribution:
${Object.entries(day.meals).map(([mealType, calories]) => `  * ${mealType}: ${calories} calories`).join('\n')}
`).join('\n')}

RECIPE SELECTION GUIDELINES - PRIORITY ORDER:
1. **MEAL TYPE APPROPRIATENESS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: 
   - ALWAYS choose foods that belong to the correct meal type
   - NEVER assign breakfast foods to dinner or vice versa
   - This rule overrides ALL other considerations

2. **Seasonal and Weather Appropriateness**:
   - Within the correct meal type, prefer seasonally appropriate options
   - Consider temperature preferences for the chosen meal type
   - Prioritize recipes marked as suitable for current season/temperature

3. **Nutritional Targets**: Meet calorie and macro requirements within meal type constraints

4. **User Preferences**: Apply dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences

5. **Variety**: Ensure diverse selection within appropriate meal types

MEAL TYPE VALIDATION PROCESS:
Before finalizing any meal selection, ask yourself:
- Is this a typical breakfast/lunch/dinner food?
- Would this meal be served at the correct time of day?
- Does this fit the meal type regardless of season?

SEASONAL & WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS (SECONDARY TO MEAL TYPE):
- Consider current weather conditions within the appropriate meal type
- For hot weather: Choose lighter versions of appropriate meal type foods
- For cold weather: Choose heartier versions of appropriate meal type foods
- Seasonal ingredients should be used within the correct meal type context

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must respond with a valid JSON object containing the meal plan. The response should be structured as follows:

{
  "meals": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "meal_type": "breakfast|lunch|dinner|snack",
      "recipe_title": "Recipe Name",
      "ingredients": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2"],
      "instructions": ["step1", "step2"],
      "calories": 500,
      "protein": 25,
      "carbs": 60,
      "fat": 15,
      "nutritional_context": "Brief explanation of why this meal fits the day"
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL JSON REQUIREMENTS:
- meal_type must be exactly one of: "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", "snack"
- dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- all nutritional values must be numbers
- ingredients and instructions must be arrays of strings
- ENSURE breakfast recipes are ONLY breakfast foods (eggs, oatmeal, toast, yogurt, etc.)
- ENSURE lunch recipes are ONLY lunch foods (salads, sandwiches, light dishes, etc.)
- ENSURE dinner recipes are ONLY dinner foods (hearty meals, proteins with sides, etc.)

FINAL VALIDATION:
Before submitting your response, verify that:
1. Each breakfast meal contains only breakfast-appropriate foods
2. Each lunch meal contains only lunch-appropriate foods  
3. Each dinner meal contains only dinner-appropriate foods
4. No meal type rules have been violated for seasonal considerations

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- The meal plan should be creative, varied, and appealing within meal type constraints
- Ensure that the recipes are easy to follow and prepare
- Consider the user's fitness goal when selecting recipes within appropriate meal types
- Provide a variety of cuisines to keep the meal plan interesting within meal type boundaries
- Adjust portion sizes to meet the daily calorie requirements
- Be concise and avoid unnecessary details
- Do not include disclaimers or warnings
- Return only the JSON object, no additional text`;
